### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on [N2JS](https://www.n2js.com/), a platform for learning and teaching coding skills with JavaScript:

* The N2JS **Essential JavaScript** course is FREE, offering over 100 lessons to help people learn to code from the very beginning.
* Anyone can take this course to learn programming skills at their own pace.
* Skills are tested with *katas*, or code challenges. N2JS runs tests on your solution to see if you passed the challenge.

Try it out, and feel free to use N2JS to teach JavaScript to someone you know!
